## Introduction

**molalib** is a Python library for doing algebra with matrices. It covers the basic operations such as matrix addition and multiplication, transposes, inverse, different norms and some decompositions. It is built from scratch without using any external libraries.

I wrote **molalib** as a hobby project to remind myself of the linear algebra methods I studied in uni and to practice my Python programming.

## Getting started

WIP

## Prerequisites

Python 3.9

## Classes

### Matrix

Represents a standard mathematical matrix with any number of rows and columns.

**set**(i,j,value)
- *i*: index of row (0 being the first row)
- *j*: index of column (0 being the first column)
- *value*: the numeric value that is assigned to the element at the given indices
